# MN PowerShell Automation Group - Pi Day Challenge

- Write a PowerShell script which runs until stopped
- On each loop, generate two random integers
- Keep count of the total loops (T) and the number of times the two random numbers are coprime (the greatest common divisor is 1) (C)
- From time-to-time, display a result that is the sqrt(6*T/C)
